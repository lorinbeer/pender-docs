# Getting Started
this document describes how to set up a Pender development environment and deploy a sample app to a device or simulator

##requirements 
- [the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
- android tools installed on your path
- python
- eclipse
only if your into that sort of thing

## Quickstart
###Python Script

1. run

    python create.py

from the tools directory of the pender repo

this will create an example Android Pender project 

2. open the Pender 

    cd Pender

3. build the Android Pender Project

    ant debug
or

    ant release

4. install on a device or simulator

    adb install bin/Pender-debug.apk

modify to the name of the apk generated by the Android build toolchain
 
## Project Setup

manually setting up a Pender project

### Command Line

1. create an empty android project

    android create project -n <ProjectName> -t <TargetID> -p <ProjectPath> -k <com.your.package> -a PenderActivity

replace the arguments with the appropriate values for your project
* <ProjectName>: name of your android project, eg PenderClient
* <TargetID>: Android OS target, type "android list target" to see a list of targets available on your system
* <com.your.package>: unique identifier for your app, reverse domain name style
* PenderActivity: java class name for the main activity, currently must be PenderActivity. You can rename it by altering the class name, file name, and the manifest.xml if desired

2. copy the pender source
    cp -r Pener-Android/src/ project/path/

3. download the pender library dependencies, [hosted on github](https://github.com/downloads/lorinbeer/pender-android/rhino1_7R2.jar)

move to the /libs folder of your android project

### Ecipse

1. Create a new project
Eclipse->File->New->Other->Android->Project From Existing Source

2. Navigate to the pender source
and click finish

3. download the pender library dependencies, [hosted on github](https://github.com/downloads/lorinbeer/pender-android/rhino1_7R2.jar)
add it to the /libs folder of your project

4. Add the rhino jar to the eclipse project build path
- right click anywhere inside your project in the project manager
- choose build path->configure build path->libraries->add jars
- add the rhino jar file in the /libs folder of your project
